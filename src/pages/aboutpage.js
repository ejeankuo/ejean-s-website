                        <p>Hello! I'm Ejean Kuo, a third-year student at Northwestern University pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science and English Literature.</p>
                        <p>I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, but I'm currently based in Evanston, IL. I love to study languages, 
                            whether it's through coding or by reading/writing, and to explore the intersection of technology and creativity.  
                            I'm always eager to learn new skills and take on exciting projects.</p>
                        <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, experimenting with new programming languages, crafting by journaling or sewing, and traveling the world!</p>
                        <p>Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my projects and resum√©. Click below to get in touch with me!</p>

                    <p>Growing up, I always thought I would pursue a career in law. I interned for the <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}><a href="https://sfdistrictattorney.org/">San Francisco District
                        <br/> Attorney Office</a></span> as well as <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}><a href="https://alpha-law.co.kr/">The Alpha Law Firm</a></span> in Seoul, South Korea, which were amazing experiences.<br/>
                        <br/>However, as I was tasked with looking through massive databases of penal codes or Supreme Court rulings, 
                        <br/> I was constantly frustrated by how clunky it was to use these tools. The more I struggled with the user  
                        <br/> experience of these sites, the more interested I got in the other side of things; specifically, 
                        <br/> <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>in how these tools were built, and how they could be improved.</span> <br/> 
                        <br/> Now, I love to code because it allows me to combine my analytical skills with my creativity to build 
                        <br/> tools that can make a difference! Check out my <Link to="/projects">projects page</Link> to see some of the things I've developed.
